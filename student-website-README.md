Hi All,

When you are trying to add to the website template that you have setup for your individual projects, please follow these steps:

1. Each project has a dedicated github branch, which is titled <project-name>. Note, the <project-name> is a placeholder that you need to replace with your actual project name.
2. Please only checkout this branch onto your machine using "git checkout <project-name>"
3. All your project files are under the oe2020/<project-name> folder. This will be your project repository, a folder that you will upload all your artefacts, and use for website rendering as well.
4. We have setup website templates for each of your projects, that are accessible at project specific URLS of the form: http://<project-name>--rpi-ontology-engineering.netlify.app/
4. When you are editing the website for your assignments, you can edit the .md files that we have created for you in your project repositories.
5. Images can be added to the images/ folder in your project repository.
6. Files can be added to the files/ folder in your project repository. 
7. We have examples on how you can embed files and images for preview on your project website. Please try and use these templates we have provided for you.
8. Also, the navigation bar of your project page is filled out by us, and if you want to edit this (e.g.:, to add options), please consult with course TA, Shruthi: charis@rpi.edu or Sam Stouffer, stoufs2@rpi.edu
  
 Finally, should you have any questions: please check the course instructions page at: https://master--rpi-ontology-engineering.netlify.app/

-Kind regards, 
Your instructors
