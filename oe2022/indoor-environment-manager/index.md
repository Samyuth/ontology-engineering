## Abstract

This project aims to develop an ontology that recommends a viable solution to improve indoor environmental quality (IEQ) for occupants and reduce energy use in a room. Buildings consume one-third of the worldâ€™s energy and are some of the major energy consumers on the planet. In commercial and residential buildings, 46.2% of the energy is consumed for heating, cooling, ventilation, and lighting. Occupants use this energy for enhancing IEQ which is affected by many factors including temperature, humidity, airflow, air quality, etc.; however, each building is under different environmental conditions, such as weather, outdoor air quality, direction/location of the building, etc. Additionally, every occupant has a different clothing level and metabolic rate. Potential solutions may be available; but, it is difficult to find them because of the complicated mechanism. In this project, we propose an ontology that suggests a viable solution to enhance IEQ and decrease energy use by combining several sets of knowledge: 1) indoor environmental conditions including air temperature, relative humidity, and air speed, 2) outdoor environmental conditions, such as outdoor air quality and daylight intensity, and 3) occupant profile including sex, height, weight, age, clothing level, and activity level. In future works, this ontology can be a basis to develop an industrial-scale IEQ management system by integrating 3D geometric models and thermodynamic simulations modules.
