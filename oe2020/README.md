Description: 
This course provides an introduction to ontologies, their uses, and an overview of their application in semantically enabled systems. Ontologies, with their declarative encodings of meaning, can be used to improve communications between people and can enable computer programs to function more effectively. They provide the foundation for clear and unambiguous interaction. Ontologies have become increasingly common on the web, and class participants will not only learn about the use of ontologies in web-based applications but how to evaluate ontologies for reuse in such applications. Participants will read relevant papers, learn how to critically review ontology papers as well as ontologies themselves, and will participate in at least one group project designing, using, and evaluating ontologies.


Goal:
To learn how to build human and machine-interpretable definitions of concepts and their relationships for use in knowledge-driven applications and automated systems.


Objectives:
Learn what ontologies are, how to build them, and how to use them
Learn what use cases are, how to construct them, and how to use them to capture requirements for ontology and applications development
Learn about terminology work, including definition development, and how to use terminologies as the starting point for ontology development
Learn about ontology languages and some existing ontology resources
Learn how to design, implement, and evaluate an ontology project


Prerequisites:
Basic knowledge of XML is expected
Basic knowledge of Artificial Intelligence and the Web is expected
