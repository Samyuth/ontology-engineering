## Abstract

This application recommends dog breeds to households given some specific characteristics of the homeowners. Additionally, the recommendation would provide a list of other potential dog breeds that may suit the familyâ€™s needs to account for any potential subjective factors like cuteness.

## Project Overview Diagrams

The Dog Breed Ontology is intended to be used with external resouces, primarily dog breed information sources, to recommend dog breeds to potential adopters. Below is the imagined system's architecture which shows how our ontology would be used. A user interface would ingest information about the potential adopter, potentially using natural language processing on a given description of the adopter. Several potential sources of dog breed information are also shown.

Below is an activity diagram of the basic flow of the system. A user enters household and individual information, and any personal preferences, which are used by the ontology to reason what requirements a breed needs to fulfill. After the user confirms that any assumptions made by the system are correct, the recommender uses the reasoning capabilities of the ontology to classify each dog breed and determine which breeds are the best fit. These are then returned to the user.

It may be that the user is unsatisfied with the results, either because they do not like a specific breed that was recommended or because they realized they needed to give the system more information about their needs and preferences. The below activity diagram shows that process.
